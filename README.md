The old and new StreamLabs Privacy Policy in markdown format since they embed it in JSON for i18n support and the wayback machine has issues (read does not display it at all) displaying it.

Un-JSONified it, parsed out the actual page text, converted HTML to MD replaces a few variables that were relevant (such as the appName).

Was hoping to originally diff the 2 for changes but it is a complete rewrite and it appears that streamlabs has a new company name that is now DBA SL.

The version used for the old version was the latest on the way back machine.

Added text to the bottom with source / TS / and who did the hack job.
