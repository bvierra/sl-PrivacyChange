### The Information Streamlabs Collects

At Streamlabs, we're constantly looking for ways to improve our offerings and develop new features that our users find valuable. In order to do so, we collect information to help us analyze behavior and interests so that we can continue to make Streamlabs better. As a general visitor to the site, you may browse our site to find more information about our offerings. You are not required to provide us with any personally identifiable information as a visitor. However, we do utilize third party Google Analytics to look at trends and to help us improve our offerings.

As a User of our site, you maybe be required to provide us with personally identifiable information. We are the sole owners of any information collected on this site, and do not share this information with others unless it is explicitly necessary to provide our Services to You.

We may also obtain information, including personal information, from third parties and other sources, such as information from the Twitch service through the Twitch API, Facebook through the Facebook API and YouTube through the YouTube API and other secure third party information sharing practices.

If you became a new user of Streamlabs OBS through downloading Streamlabs OBS via a link from an Affiliate of Streamlabs, we track your IP upon download and sign-up as an anti-fraud measure. We do not share this information, and are the sole owners of this information. We delete IP data after 90 days. You have the right to know what information we have on record for you, and you may submit the request to %{supportEmail}.

We may also use this information to maintain our services; to customize our service to meet your needs; to process transactions and donations; to collect fees or other charges; to verify your identity and prevent fraudulent transactions; to provide customer support; and to contact you.

Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about new products or services and other information we believe you'd find valuable.

Streamlabs does not sell or rent Personal Data to marketers or unaffiliated third parties. We only share your Personal Data with trusted entities, through industry standard privacy practices, which enables us to provide our services, and optimize our product experience to You.

### When Streamlabs Shares Information

Our policy is to maintain the confidentiality of the personally identifiable information of individuals except in cases when the law requires disclosure or when we have your permission to do so. Occasionally, we may share aggregated statistics of user behavior (e.g. usage patterns, donation trends, user growth, etc.) with our partners and other interested parties. This information will never identify any individual personally or contain any personally identifiable information.

Streamlabs does not sell, lease, share, rent, or otherwise provide any personally identifiable information for marketing purposes to any companies or persons outside of Streamlabs. We may provide your personally identifiable information to service providers and affiliates that provide services in conjunction with our offerings, such as payment processors, fraud protection services, or other parties assisting in improving Streamlabs. Information is securely transmitted to these affiliates, and such affiliates will only receive information necessary to provide their respective services and will be bound by confidentiality agreements limiting the use of such information. Please be aware that any personal information that you voluntarily choose to display in any public location through the use of our platform becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by others.

Streamlabs will only disclose personally identifiable information to government officials and law enforcement agencies when it is required by law (e.g. in compliance with a subpoena or court order) or if we believe in good faith that such action is appropriate and necessary to protect and defend the rights of Streamlabs, or to protect the safety of Streamlabs users, employees, affiliates, and the general public.

In the event that Streamlabs or some or all assets related to our services are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign any information we have collected from users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

### Your access to and control over information

If desired, you may decline to share your personal information with Streamlabs, at which time we will no longer be able to provide you with a majority of the functionality of our offerings. If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information, you may contact us at %{supportEmail}. Please note that in order to protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before making any changes to your personal information.

The Streamlabs website contains links to other sites that are not under our direct control. Please note that the Streamlabs Privacy Policy does not apply to these sites and Streamlabs is not responsible for, nor do we endorse, the privacy practices or the content of these sites. You should check the individual privacy policies of these sites to understand how they will utilize your personal information.

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to tell websites and services that they do not want certain information about their visits collected. We currently do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals at this time though, as the Internet industry is currently working towards accepted standardization and practices around DNT.

### Data Security

Streamlabs has strict security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. We use secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access in order to safeguard your information. While we take precautions to protect sensitive information that's transmitted online, we also protect your information offline . Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job, such as billing or customer service, are granted access to personally identifiable information. The computers/serves in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

Please note that while we continually make every effort to implement safeguards to protect your personal information, the very nature of the Internet makes it impossible to guarantee the security of transmitted data. Streamlabs makes no warranties or representations as to the security and confidentiality of any data you transmit. Any data you transmit to Streamlabs is at your own risk, and we cannot guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by any breach of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk associated with the processing of Personal Data. We maintain organizational, technical and administrative measures designed to protect Personal Data within our organization against unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration or misuse. Your Personal Data is only accessible to a limited number of personnel who need access to the information to perform their duties. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please contact us immediately at %{supportEmail}.
